# Code Nation exercise for Fellowship unit 1.4

## Objective
Coders will practice debugging a JavaScript program using their newly acquired debugging skills: `console.log`, breakpoints, and other elements of the browser developer tools.

## Exercise prompt
A spoonerism is a verbal error in which a speaker accidentally transposes the initial sounds or letters of two or more words, often to humorous effect, as in the sentence _you have hissed the mystery lectures_, accidentally spoken instead of the intended sentence _you have missed the history lectures_.

The attached code produces spoonerisms by swapping the initial letters of two words when placed in the input box, but it has some errors! Use your knowledge of debugging to investigate why the code does not work, and correct the errors.
